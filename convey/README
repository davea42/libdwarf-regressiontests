Test case supplied by Christian Convey.

Ubuntu 17.04 gcc, by default, creates COMDAT groups
in this instance.

Convey found that "-gstrict-dwarf"
removes use of COMDAT. Here we have the COMDAT
version for testing dwarfdump.

At this writing I'm not sure how to access the COMDAT
  .debug_macro data .   Each comdat just has a single
  .debug_macro section.
One would expect a COMDAT group to be a complete set,
like .debug_info and .debug_macro . Maybe. 
But that is not what gcc is emitting.
