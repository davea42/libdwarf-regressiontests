These are from Carlos Alberto-Enciso and
contain an example of the common GNU
use of the standard DW_AT_containing_type.

In dwarfdump we call a couple uses as standard.
The instance of DW_AT_containing_type under
a DW_TAG_structure_type we call an extension
(an extension not shown in the .o example here).

========new information. 2020-02-13.

In this file .rela.debug_info record 8 has addend of 0xac
And the data is in .debug_info at 0ffset 0x33. That data
is already including the offset of 0xac.

So adding the .debug_info value to the addend 
results in a string offset which is incorrect.
