These are from Carlos Alberto-Enciso and
contain an example of the common GNU
use of the standard DW_AT_containing_type.

In dwarfdump we call a couple uses as standard.
The instance of DW_AT_containing_type under
a DW_TAG_structure_type we call an extension
(an extension not shown in the .o example here).
