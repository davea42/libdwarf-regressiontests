This test executable from David Parodi demonstrates a most
unusual characteristic:  DW_FORM_ref_addr used to provide
the target of DW_AT_sibling attribute.

With October 2008 and earlier libdwarf this gets a
DW_DLE_NEXT_DIE_NULL error as dwarf_die_deliv.c had no
DW_FORM_ref_addr case in the switch on DW_AT_sibling
for dwarf_next_die().

The compiler used was Diab Data, Inc:dcc Rel 5.5.1.0:PPC5554 .

Because it makes no sense that a sibling be in another CU,
the sibling offset should be in this CU with the DW_AT_sibling
in question.
