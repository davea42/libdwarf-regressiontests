Edward Williamson sends heap_buffer_overflow.exe and
other things.  All these are damaged intentionally
by a binary test tool.

heap_buffer_overflow.exe seems to be damaged
by some sort of executable-size-minimizer, as
   readelf -S heap_buffer_overflow.exe gives errors.

dwarfdump -i heap_buffer_overflow.exe coredumps
because _dwarf_decode_u_leb128 tramps over memory
due to bogus input.

He also sends  hbo_unminimized.exe, which
is the same thing but without the damaging
minimization applied.

heap_buffer_overflow_01.exe also coredumps dwarfdump
because elf_getshdr() fails and we used stale 
libdwarf-internal data while cleaning up from that.
