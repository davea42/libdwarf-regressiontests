Edward Williamson sends heap_buffer_overflow.exe and
other things.  All these are damaged intentionally
by a binary test tool.

heap_buffer_overflow.exe seems to be damaged
by some sort of executable-size-minimizer, as
   readelf -S heap_buffer_overflow.exe gives errors.

dwarfdump -i heap_buffer_overflow.exe coredumps
because _dwarf_decode_u_leb128 tramps over memory
due to bogus input.

He also sends  hbo_unminimized.exe, which
is the same thing but without the damaging
minimization applied.

heap_buffer_overflow_01.exe also coredumps dwarfdump
because elf_getshdr() fails and we used stale 
libdwarf-internal data while cleaning up from that.


As of March 07 2016
 dwarfdump -i williamson/heap_buffer_overflow.exe
 dwarfdump -i williamson/heap_buffer_overflow_01.exe
are rejected as unreadable object by ubuntu 14.04 libelf.
FreeBSD libelf continues to accept them.
Hence FreeBSD can sometimes see an extra fail
or two  if output text
changes since dwarfdump can actually run there.
