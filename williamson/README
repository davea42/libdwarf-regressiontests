Edward Williamson sends heap_buffer_overflow.exe

heap_buffer_overflow.exe seems to be damaged
by some sort of executable-size-minimizer, as
   readelf -S heap_buffer_overflow.exe gives errors.

dwarfdump -i heap_buffer_overflow.exe coredumps
because _dwarf_decode_u_leb128 tramps over memory
due to bogus input.

He also sends  hbo_unminimized.exe, which
is the same thing but without the damaging
minimization applied.
