Jorge Gorbe Moya adds this testcase set
as it exposes further issues.

He writes:

The code after the FIXME ends up returning a
"DW_DLE_LOCLISTS_ERROR: loclists table index of 0 is unusable
without a tied file." error because the test case has more
than one loclists context.

David Blaikie:
 when reading a split-dwarf full unit the contents of
.debug_cu_index should be used instead of DW_AT_loclists_base,
and the handling should be similar to rnglistsx in split
full units.

The problem reproduces with 
dwarfdump -a -v --file-tied=loclists loclists.dwp
and the attached test case.
Note the error message complains about a missing tied
file even if we pass one.
