Stoyan Shopov notified of a some bugs.

He is using Clang 9.0.0 on Microsoft.

Target of the Elf build is arm-none-gabi.

A) compiler complains about uninitialized
   Dwarf_Sig8 (this was fixed in libdwarf/dwarfdump
   source January 16.

B) on one source file dwarfdump reports "cannot get
   forumudata on DW_FORM_loclistx" Actually the
   form is DW_FORM_rnglistx (one bug).
   In print_die.c, line 5936.
   In addition in dwarf_form.c, DW_FORM_rnglistx

Of course, please feel free to use the test ELF file as you see fit.
The source code is in this github repository:

Test file source:
https://github.com/stoyan-shopov/troll-test-drive-snapshots
The archive name is ' troll-test-drive-files-clang-dwarf5.7z'

It is a compilation of the firmware for the 'blackmagic' debug probe for arm cortex cpus, the original project is here:

The loclists are incorrect in this object.

The offset_pair is not really an offset_pair but start/end..
A compiler bug.

In addition in this run we erroneously print during a check run.
