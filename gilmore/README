Doug Gilmore pointed out on 4 October 2018 that
dwarfgen is adding pointless null die at the
end of .debug_info:


"Objects produced by Open64 (opencc) and the Tensilica Xtensa compilers
(xt-xcc) produce warnings with newer versions of readelf:

bash-3.2$ opencc ipa?.c -g -keep
bash-3.2$ readelf -wi a.out > oo
readelf: Warning: Bogus end-of-siblings marker detected at offset 91 in .debug_info section
bash-3.2$ head ipa?.c


The a.out here is such an object.

libdwarf has no 'null die' representation so
it never returns anything to callers about
the 0 byte that is a null die and instead
returns DW_DLV_NO_ENTRY to represent
the end of a die-list.
