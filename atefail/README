dwarfdump -kt  ig_server 

With dwarfdump before fixes it crashes.

With latest (June 19 2008 or so) it gets an error.
The problem is that its a relocatable and without
doing the relocation the .debug_strp offset is wrong.

The Processor is  QUALCOMM DSP6 Processor
and neither readelf nor libdwarf knows how
to actually do relocations with this object,
so anything one tries to do that involves this
won't work very well.

Relocation types found are 1 and 6. Whatever those mean.
