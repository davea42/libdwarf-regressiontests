I'm currently trying to understand a little bit more about gcc's
-fdebug-types-section option.  I wrote the C testcase:


When I compile this file with

$ gcc -g -fdebug-types-section -c minimal_fdebug_types_section.c

and run dwarfdump on the output:

$ dwarfdump -iGM minimal_fdebug_types_section.o

I see that the variable a5 to g5 are of type:

< 1><0x000000a2 GOFF=0x000000a2> DW_TAG_structure_type
                                      DW_AT_signature 0xe83beaa6d6f58683 <form DW_FORM_ref_sig8>

However, no .debug_types section appears...  In a hex-editor I
see that the debug information for struct A, B, C are present.

They appear in the dwarfdump output, when I link the object file
with a int main(void) { return 0 } routine into an executable
program.  Why can dwarfdump find the .debug_types section in
executables, but not in object files?

The short form dwarfdump option
  -x groupnumber=3
works
but the long form
   --format-group=3
seems to get rejected.
Bug in dwarfdump?
