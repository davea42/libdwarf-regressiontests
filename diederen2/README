February 02, 2015.

Arnaud Diederen kindly provided a set
of objects that have been intentionally
damaged (made to have a little bit of bad data) as a test.

Before libdwarf changes made after February 2, 2015
dwarfdump would corredump on most of them
(in libdwarf).
Now libdwarf detects the errors so
there is no coredump.
