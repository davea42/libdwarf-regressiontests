The executable here is the Go language of the source:


package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

     fmt.Println("Hello.")
}


The libdwarf consumer code was not properly
handling DW_FORM_ref_addr. 

Compiling the above using a Go compiler on a 64bit
Linux system provided the necessary object.

When dwarfdump -i is run with the 2013 version
of libdwarf the output is missing a lot of content.
With April 2014 the content shows up fully.

Source  above received April 2014.
