I attached two files that crash dwarfdump, apparently in different places. I compiled dwarfdump from source on Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64. The command lines are

dwarfdump -ka -vvv -R -M hello.test
dwarfdump -ka -x abi=arm armcc-test-dwarf2.test


The objects have bogus address_size in debug_info and those
being way too large (ie, 120) we read in too much to local variables
and trash memory.  Fixed in dwarfdump/libdwarf Sep 14, 2011


dwarfdump -a tcombined.o.div gave a divide by zero error because  the SYMTAB
sh_entrysize was zero (bogus). Now we test for zero.

dwarfdump -a tcombined.o.seg: The test for 
past-end-of-symtab was off by one, now
we test >= instead of >.  Valgrind noticed we stepped off end
of data.
