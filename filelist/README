New tests December 2021

These tests compile and run
localfuzz_init_binary.c   and localfuzz_init_path.c

WARNING these are coded badly intentionally. 

These test source behave badly by
not checking the return value and acting
accordingly.

They also fail to provide any means
to return error values to the
calling code.

We currently run these tests on corrupted
object files so they do get errors
printed (on standard error so library last-resort
error messages might be noticed).

The files checked are listed in 'fileliste'


The tests are intended to find any change
in the last-resort messages.

libdwarf never does abort() or exit()
as of version 0.3.0  and later.

The script findfilelist.sh
provides a way to find all test objects in
regressiontests, but we do not use
that long list. So do not run
findfilelist.sh unless you mean to expand
the tests dramatically.
