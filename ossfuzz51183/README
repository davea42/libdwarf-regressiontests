This one is actually an empty file.
In the ossfuzz of this issue it fails
the test code sometimes but not other times.

The problem ossfuzz has with this is a mystery to me.
Just added   print of the integer error number
(as a string) after a failed call to
dwarf_object_detector_path_b().
It returns error of
DW_DLE_FILE_TOO_SMALL(423) File is too small to be an object file.
