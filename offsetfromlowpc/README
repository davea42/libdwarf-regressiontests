This is a new test case.

In order to have a DW_AT_high_pc as an offset (instead of form address)
I constructed highpcisoffset.o from 
a particular dwarfdump.o 

/home/davea/dwarf/code/dwarfgen/dwarfgen -h -t obj -c 0 \
         -o highpcisoffset.o dwarfdump.o

Some gcc can to this automatically, but it was
better to improve dwarfgen than to search out such a gcc
at this time.


These tests attempt to verify dwarf_highpc_b() works
properly and also that dwarfgen works properly.
