This is a new test case.

In order to have a DW_AT_high_pc as an offset (instead of form address)
I constructed highpcisoffset.o from 
a particular dwarfdump.o 

/home/davea/dwarf/code/dwarfgen/dwarfgen -h -t obj -c 0 \
         -o highpcisoffset.o dwarfdump.o

Some gcc can to this automatically, but it was
better to improve dwarfgen than to search out such a gcc
at this time.

One of the tests here does dwarfgen -s  so that the
strings are generated using 
dwarf_pro_set_default_string_form(dbg,DW_FORM_strp,error ).
In that case libdwarf not only generates .debug_str,
it notices duplicate strings
and avoids emitting duplicates in .debug_str.


These tests attempt to verify dwarf_highpc_b() works
properly and also that dwarfgen works properly.
