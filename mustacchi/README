Robert Mustacchi reports that dwarfdump/libdwarf don't work
right an object file created  by Clang version 9.
The issue is equally true with Clang 6.

The object files were generated with the following commands.

clang -c -m32 -gdwarf-4 t.c -o m32t.o

clang -c -m64 -gdwarf-4 t.c -o m64t.o

m64t.o is generated with .rela sections and libdwarf
deals with them just fine.

m32t.o is generated with .rel sections, but in the relocations
for the .debug_info section strp (string) entries
the section value has zero but the symtab entry for the 
symbol the relocation refers to has a (usually) non-zero st_value.

libdwarf has not expected that .rel relocations needed
to be read!
