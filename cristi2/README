Printing of .eh_frame failed as chain_up_cie (dwarf_frame2.c) was
being asked to add to current to chain cie.  Added new tail pointer so
new cie always added at tail.

And dwarfdump was using wrong var to set table size too.

gcc 4.1.2 generates new ordering of cie-use, apparently being aggressive
about reuse of cies.
