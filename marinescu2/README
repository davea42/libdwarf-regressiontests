Hi David
I found two more testcases which you might want to look at. One causes a FP exception when trying to display the aranges section, while the other shows some invalid accesses under valgrind while looking at the info and line sections. Things like:

==3570== Invalid read of size 1
==3570==    at 0x420E8E: dwarf_read_line_table_prefix (in /data/scratchpad/libdwarf-x/dwarfdump/dwarfdump)
==3570==    by 0x405846: process_one_file (in /data/scratchpad/libdwarf-x/dwarfdump/dwarfdump)
==3570==  Address 0x4db9ca8 is 8 bytes before a block of size 12,344 free'd
==3570==    at 0x402977F: free (vg_replace_malloc.c:429)
==3570==    by 0x41B397: dwarf_dealloc (in /data/scratchpad/libdwarf-x/dwarfdump/dwarfdump)
==3570==    by 0x4057AB: process_one_file (in /data/scratchpad/libdwarf-x/dwarfdump/dwarfdump)


------------
Analysis:

Both of these objects have invalid dwarf due to compiler errors.
libdwarf gets changed so it detects the mistakes and returns an error
instead of having things fail badly.
