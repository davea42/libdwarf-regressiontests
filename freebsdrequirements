8 November 2020

To run the regressiontests on freebsd
certain packages are required.

#pkg install gmake bash
#pkg install python2 python3
Nice to have:
#pkg install rcs git

elf.h, libelf, and libz seem to be present
by default. The testscript will skip some tests
if one or more of those are missing.

======the rest is details, not important.
Until 8 November 2020 the dwarfextract test
required bfd.h for some type definitions
but...now we just define bfd_vma as unsigned
long and do not need bfd.h (never used
libbfd itself). 
(python2 is not really a requirement, but
python 3 is a requirement)

While the scripts are sh,
it is good to have bash
because the text in some
messages sort of assumes
you will be using bash for
your command line
(bash will be /usr/local/bin/bash).
Make it your shell with chsh.
