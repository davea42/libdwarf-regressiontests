This test source provided by Stoyan Shopov.

It is supposed to test that

../../dwarf-20130729/dwarfdump2/dwarfdump ERROR:  Cannot get a formstr
(or a formstrp)....:  DW_DLE_ATTR_FORM_SIZE_BAD (116)

CU Name = <unknown>
CU Producer = "<CU-missing-DW_AT_producer>"
DIE OFF = 0x00000025 GOFF = 0x000002e3, Low PC = 0x00000000, High PC =
0x00000000

arises from

dwarfdump -a main.exe

when printing the .debug_types
section.

And show that fixing dwarf_formstring() fixes the problem.

I built main.exe with gcc and that demonstrated the problem.
