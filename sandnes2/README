I have come across a problem in libdwarf 20090330.  I see
that there are newer versions released, but none of them
mention fixes in retrieval of line number information.

The problem, it seems, is that the compilation directory is
added to a file with an absolute file name.

Looking at the sourcelines with avr-readelf -wL:

I2C.c                                        448               0x51c
I2C.c                                        449               0x522
I2C.c                                        453               0x52a
I2C.c                                        454               0x536

c:/programs/winavr-20081205/lib/gcc/../../avr/include/util/delay_basic.h:
util/delay_basic.h                           105               0x538

../I2C.c:
I2C.c                                        454               0x53c
I2C.c                                        457               0x54c

It seems that a source lookup for address 0x538 we
should expect to get the file util/delay_basic.h.
Unfortunately, I get "C:\Documents and
Settings\tsandnes\Desktop\elfdwarfparser\at90usb128-i2c\at90usb128\demo\hid_generic_std\gcc/c:/programs/winavr-20081205/lib/gcc/../../avr/include/util/delay_basic.h"

I have stepped down into dwarf_linesrc() and seen that the
compilation dir is prepended to the header file.

I have attached the object file. Can you verify that this is
in case a bug in the libdwarf library?


One must use a libdwarf configured with  --enable-windowspath
to get correct Windows path concatenation.


grep 'path/c:/programs/'

should show nothing (in dwarfdump -a output) if the libdwarf configured
with --enable-windowspath and should show something if
the libdwarf not configured that way.
