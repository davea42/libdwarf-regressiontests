After some more debugging I am convinced that there's a problem
with dwarf_get_ranges_a ignoring cc_rnglists_base. I also have
enlisted David Blaikie (cc'd here) to help me interpret what
I was seeing and teach me how to make clang produce the right
DWARF to reproduce the issue and now we have a new binary
for the test suite, attached to this message :)

I haven't attached sources this time because the process is
a little tricky, modifying LLVM intermediate code by hand to
generate a "hole" so that clang would output a lexical block
with two separate address ranges. Feel free to ask for the
details if you're curious.

If you objdump -dC the attached binary you'll get the following
disassembly for the f4() function:

    0000000000401160 <f4>:

      401161:       48 89 e5                mov    %rsp,%rbp
      401164:       48 83 ec 10             sub    $0x10,%rsp

      401174:       e8 d7 ff ff ff          callq  401150 <f3>      # <==== inserted manually to create a "hole", you'll see ranges skip this call
      401179:       e8 d2 ff ff ff          callq  401150 <f3>
      40117e:       48 83 c4 10             add    $0x10,%rsp
      401182:       5d                      pop    %rbp
      401183:       c3                      retq
      401184:       66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00    nopw   %cs:0x0(%rax,%rax,1)
      40118b:       00 00 00
      40118e:       66 90                   xchg   %ax,%ax

And this is what dwarfdump -a -v --file-tied=ranges3 ranges3.dwp prints for it at HEAD
