I've been using dwarfdump to look at the debug infomation that the ARM tools put into their images, and when I run dwarfdump over them I get the following error.

   dwarfdump ERROR:  dwarf_get_fde_list:  DW_DLE_DEBUG_FRAME_LENGTH_BAD (89)

I've attached the image I used, I hope it is of some value to you, if I can a chance I will see if I can debug dwarfdump on my system to isolate the issue.

if you want other ARM images etc I'm happy to build any you may need.

Regards,
Mike.
