Created Oct 4, 2022.

The intent is the test tests.exe not be rebuilt.
See BUILD, but do not run it!

Testing DWARF2,3,4 .debug_pubnames with two distinct CUs.

dwarfgen-createirepfrombinary.o was created by
   gcc -gdwarf-4 -gpubnames
(gcc 11.2.0)
and shows the appropriate names for C++ 
such as
   'std::__exception_ptr'

Another test case:
g++ -gdwarf-5 -gpubnames -c pubname.cc

pubname.cc was compiled with a .debug_name
section for us as: dw5_names.o
