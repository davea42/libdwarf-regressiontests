     * Adding the test-alex2 directory, which is really just
       a test of the new dwarf_get_form_class() function --
       based on an already-existing test to save me time.

     * DWARFTEST.sh: Now we test that --enable-windowspath at configure
       time works.
     * PICKUPBIN:  Now builds dwarfdump with and without
       --enable-windowspath.
