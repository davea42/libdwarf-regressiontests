Remaining known issues.

Need to print the new SIG8 section.

Check for FIXME in the source.

DW_DLE_REF_SIG8_NOT_HANDLED (228) 
 -ka -vvv -R -M dwarf4/dd2g4.5dwarf-4

is the output right?
-ka -R -v -v -v -v -v -v kartashev2/combined.o

CU Name = "unsigned char"
Means relocs not done?
-kt atefail/ig_server

dwarfdump2 needs to be brought up to match dwarfdump,
starting with dwarfdump2.cc
