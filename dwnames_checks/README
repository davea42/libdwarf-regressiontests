build_dwnames.sh


build_dwnames_source.c reads libdwarf.h and creates
  C source that will self-test all the dwarf_get_OP_name
  (etc) calls.
  This is required if lcov/gcov is going to count
  all the calls in its statistics.

  It's not required to simply *test* the calls,
  as ../test_dwnames.c does that already. But those
  tests using function pointers
  seem to not be understood by gcov/lcov so
  they do not count in coverage tests..

build_dwnames_source   The executable Only built and
  used when dwarf.h  changes, which affects how many
  dwarf_get_?_ calls are needed for full coverage.

dnames_all.h is generated by
  build_dwdnames_source (when dwarf.h changes)
  and dnames_all.c includes it to have all the tests done.

dwnames_all.c is the test code. It needs dwarf.h and
   libdwarf.h and links against libdwarf/zlib/zstd.
   Recompiled for each test run.
