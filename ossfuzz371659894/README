testcase fuzz_die_cu_attrs-6661686947282944

output:
libdwarf is unable to record error DW_DLE_DIE_BAD (112) No error argument or handler available
libdwarf is unable to record error DW_DLE_ATTR_NULL (111) No error argument or handler available
libdwarf is unable to record error DW_DLE_ATTR_NULL (111) No error argument or handler available

libdwarf is unable to record error DW_DLE_STRING_FORM_IMPROPER(327 
  An internal libdwarf logic error No error argument or handler available

The sequence repeats many many times.

The repeat is not really infinite, but it might as well be infinite:
it is useless and every iteration is increasing memory usage...quickly.

Sanitizers choke on it.

I revised the testcase so in completely unreasonable situations  (really
most given the code in fuzz_die_cu_attrs.c) it stops and
reports the problem.

Updated:
libdwarf-code/fuzz/fuzz_die_cu_attrs.c
