I've had a report of a crash when dwarf_src is called with a NULL error pointer - more details are here:

  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1316695

The report believes that commit 4130f07d2 introduced the problem.


==============
The bug report by William Cohen says
(showing just a little of the report):

Thread 1 "stapdyn" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
dwarf_formstring (attr=0x55555634cb10, return_str=return_str@entry=0x7fffffffd450, error=error@entry=0x0)
    at dwarf_form.c:1183
1183	        if (dwarf_errno(*error) == DW_DLE_NO_TIED_FILE_AVAILABLE) {


The report is correct, the code was simply assuming
that error was non-null.

so in an attempt to partially test this,
we introduce the tests here using simplereader.
It's not a very precise test, but it at least shows
that the error code works as documented.
