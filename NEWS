  It is now possible to run the regression tests
  in any directory in the usual way, for example: 
  cd /tmp/dwtesting
  /path/to/regressiontests/configure
  make
  (the assumption is that here /path/to/code
  holds the libdwarf/dwarfdump source).
  We suggest using a full-path to configure.
  All testing temporary files will then be in /tmp/dwtesting.
  Running in the regressiontests directory is works too,
  with ./configure
