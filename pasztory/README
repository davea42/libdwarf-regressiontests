Akos Pasztory sends the trivial test case
November 20, 2012.

In a debug debian amd 64 kernel, the April 2012
libdwarf gets in trouble reading the dwarf because
of mishandling DW_OP_GNU_implicit_pointer.

The GNU folks sort of messed this up because for DWARF2
and DWARF3/4 the first argument is different-sized.
Check the source to GNU readelf for verification.

Unfortunately this test case causes no such trouble, the
difficulty is masked somehow.

implicitpointergcc4.7.exe is built with
on a system where 64bit is the default. So
that offset-size and pointer-size differ.
  gcc -g -O2 main.c gnuimplicitpointer.c -o a.out64
On gcc 4.7.    

With 20120-04 libdwarf and dwarfdump -i we get

/tmp/dwarfdump2-1204 ERROR:  dwarf_loclist:  DW_DLE_LOC_EXPR_BAD (128)

CU Name = "gnuimplicitpointer.c"
CU Producer = "GNU C 4.7.2"
DIE OFF = 0x0000009b GOFF = 0x0000009b, Low PC = 0x004004e0, High PC = 0x004004e7


With 2012-11 we get no such problem.
