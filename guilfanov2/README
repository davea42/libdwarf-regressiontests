An instance of a double-free.

Note that the software version is not current,
the singly-linked chain list 
does
  if (head_chain == NULL) {
            head_chain = prev_chain = curr_chain;
        } else {
            prev_chain->ch_next = curr_chain;
            prev_chain = curr_chain;
        }
in the suggested fix, but current code does
    curr_chain->ch_item = newcontext;
    ++chainlength;
    (*plast) = curr_chain;
    plast = &(curr_chain->ch_next);
    offset = nextoffset;
(a more efficient list build as there is no if/else.)
This was changed at least as of rel 0.1.1.

We are adding the testcase though, it's always good
to have a new one.
