This is a -64 ppc executable with 32bit dwarf, but the
frame section does not know it is a 32bit address.
The problem is that it is -64...

So here we arrange to let libdwarf/dwarfdump know the
correct address size.


The executable is large and mostly zeros, so we
keep it in compressed form in git.



For dwarfdump -f

dwarfdump ERROR:  dwarf_get_fde_list:  DW_DLE_CIE_RET_ADDR_REG_ERROR (91)

00

And for dwarfdump -F we get:
dwarfdump ERROR:  dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg:  DW_DLE_DF_REG_NUM_TOO_HIGH(188) (188)

The fix will be to add the capability to have an address-size
value to dwarfdump.conf (not something most will use).
