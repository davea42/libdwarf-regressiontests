Agostino Sarubbo  provides the test case here.
   dwarfdump -ka  libresolve.a
dwarfdump creates, then frees a table and re-uses it later
on another .o.  Oops.

stacktrace.txt has the analyzer output.
This is the first archive testcase in the regression tests (oops,
this sort of test should have existed all along!).
