Alex Petenchea provides a test case
related to github pull request 312.

The basic problem was he was using 
dwarf_object_init_b(), meaning 
his own code to read the object file,
and his code was not adequately checking
for errors in the object file itself.
The result was a crash (segmentation
violation) in libdwarf.

The pull request added a new test
in libdwarf
making up for the lack of the
check in his object reading code.

We don't have an object reader making that mistake,
so this test case never did fail in regression testing
and an error is reported.
