"I have another bug to report, it looks like you can hop
the data pointer in the body of build_array_of_lle with
a corrupted entrylen parsed from read_single_lle_entry
causing an out of bounds access."

The bug was created in June 2020 when
dwarf_loclists.c was added to libdwarf.

SIGSEGV-a.fuzz is the fuzzed test object he provides.
-fsanitize and valgrind noted the error.
