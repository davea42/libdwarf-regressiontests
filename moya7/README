Another nice testcase from Jorge Gorbe Moya.

Demonstrating a leak in line table code.

We've recently found via fuzzing a
memory leak in read_line_table_program. At
dwarf_line_table_reader_common.h:1232 the function
returns an error without freeing head_chain. It can be
reproduced by running an AddressSanitizer-enabled dwarfdump
--suppress-de-alloc-tree on the attached test case (valgrind
should work as well, but I haven't tried).

Adding a call to _dwarf_free_chain_entries(dbg, head_chain,
line_count) before returning the error fixes the problem
for me.
