  * dwarfdump-i386-freebsd.O,dwarfdump-x86_64-freebsd.O: The old
    FreeBSD 9 versions simply won't run on FreeBSD 11.1.
    So now we start afresh with a new FreeBSD 11.1
    environment.
  * dwgena/runtest.sh: FreeBSD 11.1 has a one-second-different
    idea of what ctime(&x) means where x = 0 as compared
    to Linux. This papers over that irrelevant (to libdwarf) difference.

  Added test with a 'new' relocation seen for the first time.
  DWARFTEST.sh

  Added words about libelf and naming files with
  special and interesting characteristics relating
  to groups.
    README.txt

  Nothing special, just examples.
    RUN

  New baselines with Group info present.
  Should have been in a previous update!

  * DWARFTEST.sh: unifyddname now just renames files. No
    need for sed to remove the .O from the program name
    dwarfdump prints.  See code/dwarfdump/NEWS or
    code/dwarfdump/ChangeLog.

  * DWARFTEST.sh: Added tests for marcel directory testcases.
  * RUNALL.sh: Added code to compute number of minutes wall clock
    a full test run takes.
