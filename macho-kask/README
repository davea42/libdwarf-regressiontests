Eerie Kask provides these objects, 32 and 64bit
mach-o, as test files.
These are from a slight modification of
dwarfexample/simplereader.c provided by EK.

one dsym is:
simplereaderi386 

The following is that same dsym,but
renamed and placed in a lower directory 
following MacOS practice so if 

#First a placeholder file, which would normally
#be a MacOS object.

mach-o-object32    

# Next the top of a directory tree which leads to the
# same dsym content as simplereaderi386.
mach-o-object32.dSYM
# The point being to test the ability of libdwarf to
#automatically drill down the the .dSYM.

# similarly for the X86_64 case.
