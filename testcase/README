This testcase can be used to verify the decoding of dwarf line
numbers. The program will print two line numbers, between which the
main function of the program should be (give or take). The binary
files (testcase.o & testcase) have been compiled using
"gcc (GCC) 4.0.3 20060212 (prerelease) (Debian 4.0.2-9)"

The dwarfdump program should probably print something close to the
output stored in the "VERIFY" file, if run as:

dwarfdump -l testcase.o
