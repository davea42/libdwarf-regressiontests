April 26, 2016. Yue Liu reports:

I found a out bound READ bug in lastest libdwarf, and the offset can be controlled between a range from 0 to 0xFFFFFFFF.

#0  _dwarf_decode_u_leb128 (leb128=leb128@entry=0x41a6c02d <error: Cannot access memory at address 0x41a6c02d>, leb128_length=leb128_length@entry=0x7fffffffd418) at dwarf_leb.c:57

Segment Fault at dwarf_leb.c:57 :

  53         /*  The following unrolls-the-loop for the first few bytes and
  54             unpacks into 32 bits to make this as fast as possible.
  55             word_number is assumed big enough that the shift has a defined
  56             result. */
  57         if ((*leb128 & 0x80) == 0) {                <- $pc
  58             if (leb128_length != NULL)
  59                 *leb128_length = 1;
  60             return (*leb128);
  61         } else if ((*(leb128 + 1) & 0x80) == 0) {

My analysis: none of the uleb reading is checked to ensure it does
not run off the end.

test case:
outofboundread2.elf
========== 

When there were bogus relocation records
we could write outside the malloc space in memory.
Now we check for that. And in the case of dwarf_srcfiles()
in dwarfdump (this test case) we report that we had an error and
are attempting to continue.

test case:
heapoverflow01.elf
========== 

This test exposed a logic bug in dwarf 5 macros.
In case of error there would be a duplicate free
in dwarf_finish(). 


test case:
outofbound01.elf

============
This is an info section with zero length, so 
there is no pointer to the section in libdwarf.

test case:
null01.elf

==========

Corrupt dwarf in the aranges section showed
some checks were needed in dwarf_arange.c

testcase:
infiniteloop.elf
