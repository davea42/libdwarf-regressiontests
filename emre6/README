Emre Kultursay provided these tests March 4, 2017.

There were problems with location lists (in dwarf_loc2.c)
which he noticed via these testcases.

Before March 4 the result of
dwarfdump -i  class_64_opt_fpo_split.dwp

was
dwarf_get_loclist_c:  DW_DLE_POINTER_SECTION_UNKNOWN (344)

After the fix the run proceeds to a normal end.
