Using valgrind and fuzz/fuzz_debug_str.c

we find a warning about using uninitilized values.

Because the value was not initialized by
fuzz_debug_str.c.
Even though an uninitialized value cause no trouble
in terms of correctness
it is wrong to do because it makes the test output
behave in unpredictable ways under valgrind.
