This test case is a Rust build of a
fully open source application that
gdb has a problem with.

Clifton 
Builder: Dominic Clifton
Issue: Fixing gdb crash issue when loading an elf file compiled, with rust 1.87.0 gdb crash

Other builds have no such problem.

It is not yet clear what the problem is.

We have the tar.xz form here as the uncompressed
form is 8.7 MN, vs 1.3MB for the compressed.

We will need to add a tar xzf in the startup part
of DWARFTEST.sh and run tests against the
expanded blinky.
