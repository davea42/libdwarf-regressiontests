This test case is a Rust build of a
fully open source application that
gdb has a problem with.

Clifton 
Builder: Dominic Clifton
Issue: Fixing gdb crash issue when loading an elf file compiled, with rust 1.87.0 gdb crash
Other builds have no such problem.

The DWARF is version 4.

The .debug_loc ranges and .debug_ranges have many
bogus entries. Many may be ok, but lots are
clearly nonsense. Not random junk, but
impossible ranges, given the addresses in the
object are 0x100xxx.

The object references NO libraries, there
is no dynamic section, no shared object in use.
Not even libc. Intended for an ARM cpu board.

We have the tar.xz form here as the uncompressed
form is 8.7 MN, vs 1.3MB for the compressed.

We will need to add a tar xzf in the startup part
of DWARFTEST.sh and run tests against the
expanded blinky.
