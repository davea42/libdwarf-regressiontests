This exposes the bug in release 20190104.
It was found by Steve Kaufmann when
his application crashed reading an object
with no DWARF present.

cc -c t.o
and then munge the .eh_frame section name
in the .o. I changed the name to .eh_
with my patch program as in

binpatch 0x7ca 0x66 0x00 t.o

changing a letter f to a NUL byte.

dwarfdump and libdwarf refuse to work
on such an object with no DWARF.
