This exposes the bug in release 20190104.
It was found by Steve Kaufmann when
his application crashed reading an object
with no DWARF present.

The object file t.o is used in
the debugfissionb/runtest.sh script

=====HOW THE t.o WAS CREATED
(which is done, leave the t.o here
unchanged. This is just documentation.)

cc -c t.o
and then munge the .eh_frame section name
in the .o. I changed the name to .eh_
with my patch program as in

binpatch 0x7ca 0x66 0x00 t.o

changing a letter f to a NUL byte.

dwarfdump and libdwarf refuse to work
on such an object with no DWARF.
But we test it to ensure there is no
segmentation violation in libdwarf
for the case.
