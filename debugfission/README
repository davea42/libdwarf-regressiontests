This is the start of testing DebugFission object.

Cary Coutant supplied the object files.

Update May 2, 2023.
copied archive.o to mungegroup.o
Modified the group content at 0xa8 to look like
that at 0x98.
That way it fails in a section error as there is
a duplicat use of a section that libdwarf
does not care about.  As of yesterday libdwarf
understands it is a don't care and lets it pass ok.
