This is a simple test of dwarf_get_cu_die_offset_given_cu_header_offset
and dwarf_CU_dieoffset_given_die and offdie.

It is self testing: exits with 0 on success and 1 on failure.

If you update cutest.save you will have to revise the test,
it depends on a rather arbitrary choice and its CU having
a specific names.
