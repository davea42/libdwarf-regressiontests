demo.cpp.o 
A modern Mach-o object using recent Mac compiler.
As a .o it has code and DWARF.
It also leaves segment names empty,
so libdwarf has to change to read it properly,
as does readobjmacho.

test-mach-o-32.dSYM
An older dsym file, meaning it is a companion
file and as such has only DWARF in it.
The same object is in the 'make check' 
test object set of libdwarf.
