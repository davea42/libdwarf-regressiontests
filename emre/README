     dwardump -a input.o

generates:

.debug_types
dwarfdump ERROR:  attempting to print .debug_types:  DW_DLE_DEBUG_TYPEOFFSET_BAD (239) (239)


This is due to a mistake in calculating the end of data bytes in a section.

Noticed by Emre Kultursay, who also generated the script
that creates the nice test case.
