We're experiencing what looks like a bug in libdwarf's frame
info parsing. With libdwarf-20090510 and all later versions
we get bad register values out of dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg3.
With libddwarf-20090330 and earlier we get the kinds of values
we expect to see.  I've verified that this is still happening
as of libdwarf-20091230.

I've put together a small test case and the x86_64 library
we're seeing this in, which are available at:

http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~legendre/dwarf_frame_bug.tar.gz

This contains a library, libmpich.so.1.0, and a simple libdwarf
program, frame_test.c.  frame_test.c open libmpich.so.1.0
and will produce 'Got reg value 1036' with the older versions
of libdwarf, and 'Got reg value 0' with the newer versions.
The 1036 value leads to frame recipies that make sense of
the given code, while the 0 value seems incorrect.

Thanks, 
Matt
