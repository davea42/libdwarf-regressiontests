A problem noted in libdwarf github issue #243

Jeremy Rifkin found that gcc is generating a
.debug_addr which is not in the format that
DWARF5 specifies.


Instead it is the format defined in
https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DebugFission 
which is not the same as the format that
the DWARF committee specified in DWARF5.

Jeremy writes, in the issue:

Here's a small example (built from
https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/cpptrace/tree/dev with

    cmake -S . -B build -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
    -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=On
    -DCPPTRACE_BUILD_TESTING=On
    -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-gsplit-dwarf"
    -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-gsplit-dwarf" -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=On

The objects here, demo and  demo.cpp.dwo
are the result of the build.
