This is a test for a failure in allocating an error
record with a NULL Dwarf_Debug using
a libdwarf interface that lets us do that easily, with
no open Dwarf_Debug required.

The intent is to ensure that
_dwarf_special_no_dbg_error_malloc() actually
returns a pointer to the space allocated.
Unfortunately with gcc (as of the current
implemenation) the absence of a return
has no effect. Ugh. Not too good a test then.

With NLIZE it expects there is a memory leak.
