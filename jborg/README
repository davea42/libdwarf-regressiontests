Simple was built by Jason Borg and provided as a test
case demonstrating a failure in libdwarf.

The llvm version is creating .debug_pubnames
but is putting all global offsets into the entry records,
whereas the DIE offsets each entry refers to 
are defined by DWARF as offsets from the CU header
in .debug_info.

Thank you, Jason, for the nice test case.
simple.go is the source code compiled to produce
the testcase.
