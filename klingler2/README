#Gernot Klingler supplied the xenial
#object files (xenial being the next Ubuntu
#release, I gather).

#It has an unknown (according to current
#readelf) flag on the .debug* sections
#so one thinks those are compressed somehow.
#
# We renamed the object from xenial
#   compresseddebug.amd64

#We don't use the reader test, but compiling it involves
#something like
