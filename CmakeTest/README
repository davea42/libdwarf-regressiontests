This is a test of using a cmake feature to download and
build libdwarf.

To run the test from this directory

  cmake ./cmaketest
  make

This creates a _deps directory with the libdwarf
data and it creates the executable 'myprogram'
from compiling test.c and linking against
the libdwarf.a that the FetchContent enabled.

To remove all the files created, do

  sh CLEAN

If you have a dwarf.h and libdwarf.h
visible in a standard include directory
the test is not a complete test.
If, by hand, you type
    cc test.c
in this directory it must fail on the
#includes for this to be a full test.

Otherwise the test is still useful
as it will link against the cmake-built
libdwarf created here.
