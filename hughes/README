Tom Hughes points out a lack of handling a couple
GNU extensions.  And provides the test cases seen here.


The base testcase is libkrb5support.so.0.1.debug
and it has DW_FORM_GNU_ref_alt and DW_FORM_strp_alt forms.
And also uses DW_FORM_exprloc form.
The alt forms give offsets in alternate object
which is referred to in a .gnu_debugaltlink section.

The alternate image is here, named krb5-1.11.3-38.fc20.x86_64  

To get full output, use -x tied=krb5-1.11.3-38.fc20.x86_64
