It's still possible, as of the latest libdwarf snapshots, to generate a binary with debugging information that causes dwarf_next_cu_header_c to crash.

Reproducer snippet, all types as per the function prototype:

while (dwarf_next_cu_header_c(dbg, is_info,
                              &cu_header_length,
                              &version,
                              &abbrev_offset,
                              &addr_size,
                              &offset_size,
                              &extension_size,
                              &signature,
                              &typeoffset,
                              &next_cu_header, &err) == DW_DLV_OK ) {
	// process sig8 types, but should be irrelevant to reproduction of bug
}


A representative binary that should produce this crash is attached.

If you need a full reproducer, I can build and send one, but I hope this is sufficient.
