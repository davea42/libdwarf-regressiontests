This test case from freejack811 has test.h with
a number of blank lines so its line numbers
are higher than any lines in main.cc.

That makes it much easier to identify the correctness/
incorrectness of line table data.

It shows that in gcc 11.2.0 the compiler is defaulting
to a line table file number of 1.

(Do not redo the builds)
Build with gcc -g main.cc -o main
Build with clang -g main.cc -o mainclang14

dwarfdump -l
dwarfdump -l -v
dwarfdump -l -vv
(do 3 runs) show this clearly, demonatrating what
the .debug_line section contains.
