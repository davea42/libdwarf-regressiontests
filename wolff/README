CVE-2017-9998 in libdwarf

An overflow in adding leads to failing to notice
some bad data.
The suggestion below fails to take account of
ptrdiff_t being signed so the compare gets a warning.

email from Fabian Wolff:

The issue seems to be that while the code in _dwarf_get_value_ptr does
some error checking, the check that should detect the invalid pointer
fails to do so due to an integer overflow. Something like this should
fix this problem:

+++ b/libdwarf/dwarf_query.c
