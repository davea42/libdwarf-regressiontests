James Grumbach supplies a small object file to 
demonstrate that dwarfdump fails to print
a DW_AT_discr_list properly.

dwarfdump was not coded to accept a DW_FORM_block*
so dwarfdump was wrong.

test2.o is a copy of James' object but with
the initial discriminant changed to a x41
which (as sleb) is interpreted as 0xffffffc1
(-63) due to the way sleb works.
So we validate the leb checking.

test_fixed.o test_biased.o are some ELF object files with the "new" DW_AT_GNU_numerator, DW_AT_GNU_denominator and DW_AT_GNU_bias DWARF attributes.
