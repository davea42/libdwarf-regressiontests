   * CHECKIFRUNNING.sh: Quote some paths with "".
   * CLEANUP: Add cleanup of temp files in checkforzlib
     directory.
   * DWARFTEST.sh:a Now supports options withlibelf or nolibelf.
     So we can avoid tests that rely on libelf when there
     is no libelf.  If cc is not available (as a command)
     try gcc instead.  Separate out things like the -E and -o
     options so if no libelf we do not use those dwarfdump
     options. If we don't have certain /usr/bin/time options
     suppress the use of /usr/bin/time.
   * Makefile.in: Pick up withlibelf/nolibelf from configure.
     Pass one or the other on to other scripts.
   * PICKUPBIN: Now allow nolibelf option so we do not
     try to build things (dwarfgen!) that cannot possibly
     build.
   * README.txt: Documenting the new configure etc options.
   * RUNALL.sh: How honors nolibelf/withlibelf .
   * RUNTIMEFILES: If we cannot use the /usr/bin/time
     -o option (because it's not available) then turn off
     using /usr/bin/time.  The summing of user time etc
     across the processes is not that important.
   * baddie/runtest.sh: Remove use of /usr/bin/time
   * config.h.in: add DWARF_WITH_LIBELF HAVE_DWARFGEN
     for proper test setup by configure.ac.
   * configure.ac: Add --disable-libelf option 
     so we can avoid pointless test failures for thing
     that cannot work without libelf.
   * configure: Regenerated.
   * debugfission/runtest.sh: When zcat missing use
     gzcat (MacOS).
   * dwarfextract/runtest.sh,err_allocate/runtest.sh,
     findcu/runtest.sh,frame1/runtest.sh,
     legendre/runtest.sh,navarro/runtest.sh,
     strsize/runtest.sh,test-alex2/runtest.sh,
     testoffdie/runtest.sh: Now 
     honor lack of libelf
     and will not try to link with it if libelf is missing.
   * test_harmless.c: Now uses dwarf_init_path() as
     that allows it to work on MacOS with dSYM debug.
   * s390fails: Just internal documentation, most
     now deleted as tests pass on s390.
   * dwgena/runtest.sh,enciso4/runtest.sh: When zcat missing use
     gzcat (MacOS).

   * RUNALL.sh,baddie1/runtest.sh,bigobj/runtest.sh,
     data16/runtest.sh,debugfission/runtest.sh,
     debugfissionb/runtest.sh,dwarfextract/runtest.sh,
     dwgena/runtest.sh,dwgenc/runtest.sh,
     enciso4/runtest.sh,err_allocate/runtest.sh,

     offsetfromlowpc/runtest.sh,strsize/runtest.sh,
     test-alex1/runtest.sh,test-alex2/runtest.sh,
     testoffdie/runtest.sh, williamson/runtest.sh:
     Doing a better job (in echo statements) to report
     what passed, and in some cases, what failed.
     Making it easier to work with the results.

   * dwarfdump-s390.O: Corrected libdwarf endianness issues
     so the s390  big endian dwarfdump works as well as the
     little-endian versions do.
2019-10-05 David Anderson
   * dwgena/test2.base.gz,dwgena/test4.base.gz,dwgena/test7.base.gz,
     dwgena/test8.base.gz,dwgena/test9.base.gz: Changed dwarfgen
     setting of the standard opcodes from 10 to 13 (to match
     common practice) so this update the baselines to account
     for the 3 extra bytes in the header.
2019-10-04 David Anderson
   * offsetfromlowpc/baseadvlocf,offsetfromlowpc/baseadvlocvf,
     offsetfromlowpc/runtest.sh: Now the test of the advance-8
     CFA instruction applies to a 64bit pointer object and
     the fde code-length is adjusted usefully.
2019-09-17 David Anderson
   * DWARFTEST.sh: Now uses testendian.c
     to determine test host endianness.
   * test_dwarfnames.c,test_harmless.c: Indentation
     fixed and trailing whitespace removed.
   * testendian.c: New test for test host endianess
     as at least one test (dwarfextract) was not
     written to allow anything but little-endian testing.
   * debuglink/crc32.c,debuglink/runtest.sh: These
     now adjust so that, for test purposes, the hex output
     is identical for little vs big endian test hosts.
2019-04-25 David Anderson
   * PICKUPBIN: Now builds a dwarfdump with --disable-libelf
     and copies it to the top level for testing as dwarfdumpnl.
   * nolibelf: Added directory for testing a nolibelf dwarfdump
     which is named dwarfdumpnl here.
   * CLEANUP: rm dwarfdumpnl.
   * DWARFTEST.sh: run nolibelf/runtest.sh
   * nolibelf:  A directory with the test script and test files.
   * encisoa: A directory with new test object relating to
     DW_AT_containing_type use in gcc.
2019-01-14 David Anderson
   * DWARFTEST.sh: Added comments so it will be easier
     to understand where certain tests are really
     done.
   * dwarfdump-i386-freebsd.O,dwarfdump-i386-ubuntu.O,
     dwarfdump-x86_64-freebsd.O,dwarfdump-x86_64-ubuntu.O:
     New baseline executables.
   * dwgena/test7.base.gz: We now continue from some line table
     errors so that changes the baseline a little.
   * offsetfromlowpc/baseadvlocf,offsetfromlowpc/baseadvlocvf,
     offsetfromlowpc/runtest.sh: New test case for 
     DW_CFA_advance_loc* operations.
2019-01-10 David Anderson
   * DWARFTEST.sh,CLEANUP,PICKUPBIN: In preparation
     for moving to pre-build dwarf_names.c we
     do not explicitly test gennames here.
