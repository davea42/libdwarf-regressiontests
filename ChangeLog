    commit bd6887df3ed4cbe9f7879d2fb0eb5b514ffd078b

    Adding -v and -vv --print-debug-names tests.
            modified:   DWARFTEST.sh
    New baseline.
            modified:   dwarfdump-x86_64-ubuntu.O

    Removing dwarfgen trying to force a .debug_names
    section, we have real such sections now.
    The dwarfgen/libdwarfp code for the force
    is not quite right and should be fixed and
    reintroduced...just because.

    commit bb44bed9b8fe86e4c04340363bffa6c1d81efddb

    The baseline had full paths which is not portable.
    So now we just show the basename of each path
    in the echoed output.
