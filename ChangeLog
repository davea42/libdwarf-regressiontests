    * DWARFTEST.sh:  Now allows a shorter test (not one that
      should be routinely used, but handy once in a while)
    * dwarfdump-i386-ubuntu.O,dwarfdump-x86_64-freebsd.O,
      dwarfdump-x86_64-ubuntu.O: New baselines with improved
      reporting of dwarf5 line table headers.

    * DWARFTEST.sh: Added one-time messags about timing.
      Revised the check for timeing functionality so all
      tests here of that are consistently expressed
      (The inconsistent one was wrong).
    * RUNTIMEFILES: It has been failing to do what it should
      (so we record user and system time of the tests)
      for some time, but now is fixed and we emit a one-time
      message saying how the check here went..
    * python2/showpct.py,python3/showpct.py: These now get
      a sensible percent-done and are more easily maintainable.
2020-02-16 David Anderson
    * DWARFTEST.sh: Ensuring the libelf-reading code is tested now
      by adding -oi option to nearly all test sets. Now the
      overall test-run count is about 51000.
    * dwarfdump-i386-ubuntu.O,dwarfdump-x86_64-freebsd.O,
      dwarfdump-x86_64-ubuntu.O: New baselines with .rela and .rel
      issues fixed.

    * python2/showpct.py,python3/showpct.py: Fix percent
      denominator.
    * showpct.py: Ensure this one not used by altering print()
