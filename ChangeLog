     * dwarfextract/dwarfextract.c: Force __WORDSIZE to 32
       for our test purposes.  Simpler to have just one
       test to keep up todate, and adequate.

     * dwarfdump2-x86_64-linux-gnu.O,dwarfdump-x86_64-linux-gnu.O:
       new, 64bit Ubuntu 12.10 executables.
2012-02-03  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * In RUNALL.sh, a temp file was not getting deleted,
       now it is.
2012-01-31  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * configure.in: Now it simply looks for a dwarfdump*.O
       and dwarfdump2*.O to make them the dwarfdump[2].O
       for testing.  Because sometimes a 32bit executable
       will work as well as 64bit in a 64bit kernel.
       And possibly one is surprised where an executable will work.
     * configure: Regenerated.
     * findexecutable.base: A valid snippet of dwarfdump output
       which is part of a basic sanity test that an executable 
       is usable as the 'previous dwarfdump version'.
     * Makefile.in: Makes it easy to run a single test now.
2012-01-31  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * DWARFTEST.sh: Pass to dwgena and dwarfextract 
       the dwarfdump name to test against.
     * dwarfextract/dwarfextract.c: Fix some incompatibilites
       with FreeBSD.
     * dwarfextract/runtests.sh: Expects the dwarfdump path to run it.
     * dwarfextract/test1: Made this executable saved, not always
       rebuilt: makes the test repeatable across compiler releases.
     * dwgena/runtest.sh: Expects the dwarfdump path to run it.
     * dwgena/test1.base.gz: Updated with corrected dwarfgen results.
     * dwgena/test2.base.gz: Updated with corrected dwarfgen results.
     * dwgena/test3.base.gz: Updated with corrected dwarfgen results.
     * dwgena/test4.base.gz: Updated with corrected dwarfgen results.
2012-01-26  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * updated dwarfdump2.O dwarfdump.O with latest.
2012-01-25  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * updated dwarfdump2.O dwarfdump.O with latest.
2012-01-25  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * Added libc6fedora18 directory with an x86_64
       debug libc that coredumps dwarfdump as of the 20121130
       release.
2012-01-16  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * A new year starts.
