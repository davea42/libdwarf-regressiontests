  * usertime.py: New python to print dwarfdump user/sys time.
  * DWARFTEST.sh: Uses /usr/bin/time to record user/sys time
    per dwarfdump run at top level (the scripts in 
    directories do not count in these times so far).

  * DWARFTEST.sh:New testcases (liu directory) and improved corruption checking
    plus new uri-style output so bogus characters show more
    recognizably. New baseline executables.
  * debugfission/targeto.base.gz: new baseline.
  * dwarfdump-i386-freebsd.O,dwarfdump-i386-ubuntu.O,dwarfdump-x86_64-freebsd.O,
    dwarfdump-x86_64-ubuntu.O: New baseline executables.

  These are wall clock of the full regression test suite.
  So not terribly meaningful. But suggestive that the latest
  additions to correctness checking have not impacted performance
  noticably.

  This version does have extra tests, but there are small
  and there are not many of them.

     * DWARFTEST.sh: hughes2 directory which uses simplereader
       to verify that the various error recovery possibilities
       all work.
     * */runtest.sh: ensured all start with #!/bin/sh

     * dwarfextract/dwarfextract.c: Add #defines so the test will build
       with bfd.h on FreeBSD  10.2
     * legendre/RUNTEST.sh: gcc->cc so this works on FreeBSD 10 too.
     * test-alex2/RUNTEST: gcc->cc so this works on FreeBSD 10 too.

     * A new year starts.
