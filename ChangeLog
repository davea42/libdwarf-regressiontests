     * dwarfextract: Inserting more thorough test code
       into runtests.sh script and adding new baselines
       so we can be sure we compiled in the right calls
       for the particular test (dwarf_producer_init_c or
       dwarf_producer_init) so we test both.
     * CLEANUP: Cleans out new temp files created by runtests.sh
