   * DWARFTEST.sh: Added comments so it will be easier
     to understand where certain tests are really
     done.
   * dwarfdump-i386-freebsd.O,dwarfdump-i386-ubuntu.O,
     dwarfdump-x86_64-freebsd.O,dwarfdump-x86_64-ubuntu.O:
     New baseline executables.
   * dwgena/test7.base.gz: We now continue from some line table
     errors so that changes the baseline a little.
   * offsetfromlowpc/baseadvlocf,offsetfromlowpc/baseadvlocvf,
     offsetfromlowpc/runtest.sh: New test case for 
     DW_CFA_advance_loc* operations.

     for moving to pre-build dwarf_names.c we
     do not explicitly test gennames here.
