     * dwarfgena/test<n>.base.gz: New baselines
       due to adding more coverage to dwarfgen.
       CU-local references now handled.
     * dwarfgena/runtest.sh: Added echo lines to make it clearer
       to run the test by hand.
2013-08-09  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * shopov1/main.exe: New test object for FORM_string
       in debug_types.
     * DWARFTEST.sh: Run all options on shopov1/main.exe.
2013-08-07  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * DWARFTEST.sh: Now do unifyddname on stdout as well
       as stderr.  Now that non-fatal errors always come out
       on stdout.
2013-07-28  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * DWARFTEST.sh: Added juszkiewicz directory with AARCH64 objects.
     * dwarfdump-x86-ubuntu-12.10.O,dwarfdump2-x86-ubuntu-12.10.O,
       dwarfdump-x86_64-ubuntu-12.10.O,dwarfdump2-x86_64-ubuntu-12.10.O:
       with changes supporting AARCH64 as a baseline.
2012-03-08  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * k10m: directory with k10m object file.
       Same relocations as x86.
     * DWARFTEST.sh: now runs dwarfdump on the k10m object. 
     * .O versions of dwarfdump[2]. updated.
2012-02-06  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * badddie1: directory with new tests exhibiting error messages
       catching DW_AT_sibling errors in compiler output.
     * DWARFTEST.sh: now runs the baddie1 directory tests.
     * .O versions of dwarfdump[2]. updated.
2012-02-05  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarfextract/dwarfextract.c: Force __WORDSIZE to 32
       for our test purposes.  Simpler to have just one
       test to keep up todate, and adequate.
2012-02-04  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarfdump2-x86_64-linux-gnu.O,dwarfdump-x86_64-linux-gnu.O:
       new, 64bit Ubuntu 12.10 executables.
2012-02-03  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * In RUNALL.sh, a temp file was not getting deleted,
       now it is.
2012-01-31  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * configure.in: Now it simply looks for a dwarfdump*.O
       and dwarfdump2*.O to make them the dwarfdump[2].O
       for testing.  Because sometimes a 32bit executable
       will work as well as 64bit in a 64bit kernel.
       And possibly one is surprised where an executable will work.
     * configure: Regenerated.
     * findexecutable.base: A valid snippet of dwarfdump output
       which is part of a basic sanity test that an executable 
       is usable as the 'previous dwarfdump version'.
     * Makefile.in: Makes it easy to run a single test now.
2012-01-31  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * DWARFTEST.sh: Pass to dwgena and dwarfextract 
       the dwarfdump name to test against.
     * dwarfextract/dwarfextract.c: Fix some incompatibilites
       with FreeBSD.
     * dwarfextract/runtests.sh: Expects the dwarfdump path to run it.
     * dwarfextract/test1: Made this executable saved, not always
       rebuilt: makes the test repeatable across compiler releases.
     * dwgena/runtest.sh: Expects the dwarfdump path to run it.
     * dwgena/test1.base.gz: Updated with corrected dwarfgen results.
     * dwgena/test2.base.gz: Updated with corrected dwarfgen results.
     * dwgena/test3.base.gz: Updated with corrected dwarfgen results.
     * dwgena/test4.base.gz: Updated with corrected dwarfgen results.
2012-01-26  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * updated dwarfdump2.O dwarfdump.O with latest.
2012-01-25  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * updated dwarfdump2.O dwarfdump.O with latest.
2012-01-25  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * Added libc6fedora18 directory with an x86_64
       debug libc that coredumps dwarfdump as of the 20121130
       release.
2012-01-16  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * A new year starts.
