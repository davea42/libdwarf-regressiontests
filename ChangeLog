   * dwarfdump-i386-freebsd.O,dwarfdump-i386-ubuntu.O,
     dwarfdump-x86_64-freebsd.O,dwarfdump-x86_64-ubuntu.O:
     Updated baselines for improved test of corrupted dwarf.
   * dwgena/test2.base.gz,dwgena/test4.base.gz,dwgena/test6.base.gz,
     dwgena/test7.base.gz,dwgena/test8.base.gz,dwgena/test9.base.gz,
     dwgenc/testoutput.o: Updated baselines to match the
     one-byte-shorter change of pro_section.c
2018-10-14  David Anderson
  * DWARFTEST.sh: Adding gilmore/a.out to the files to test with.
  * dwgenc/testoutput.o: Now one byte shorter due to the 
    correction in libdwarf/pro_section.c  that eliminates
    a useless zero-byte being emitted.
2018-09-29  David Anderson
  * SHALIAS.sh: New. Those with non-GNU make
    will wish to modify this (see its comments)
    as the tests do require GNU make.
  * CHECKIFRUNNING.sh, CLEANUP,DWARFTEST.sh,PICKUPBIN,
    RUNALL.sh: Now refer to ./SHALIAS.sh so the appropriate
    alias can be created for make (Useful on non-linux).
  * README.txt: Some comments about SHALIAS.sh and its use.
2018-07-28  David Anderson
  * DWARFTEST.sh: Removed unnecessary early report of FAIL count.
  * README.txt: Added mention of specific ulimit commands
    to avoid a failure in a test that requires a coredump.
  * RUNALL.sh: Revise the wording to expect a single
    "FAIL 0" if the tests all go well.
    Remove some obsolete code referring to "dd".
2018-07-21  David Anderson
  * offsetfromlowpc/runtest.sh: Added checking for successful
    compiles and tests, generating FAIL when things go wrong.
2018-07-19  David Anderson
  * CLEANUP: Added cleanup of navarro/getglobals
2018-07-19  David Anderson
  * DWARFTEST.sh,test-alex1/runtest.sh,test-alex2/runtime.sh: 
    Had to pass more information so out-of-trunk source 
    build got key data for compiles in these tests.
2018-06-08  David Anderson
  * DWARFTEST.sh: Now provides identifying string to the Count output.
  * runtimesummary: New data
  * usertime.py: Now prints the identifying string passed in.
    Easier to understand what runtime is what.

  * A runtest of emre5 directory objects was typed 
    incorrectly and has only been
    generating a usage message for quite some time.
    It now tests dwp and tied files as it is supposed to.
  * README.txt: Now mentions that at least one test
    assumes that a segmentation violation will create a
    core file (the test fails if ulimit or something else
    prevents or moves core files).
2018-01-29  David Anderson
  * dwarfdump-i386-freebsd.O,dwarfdump-x86_64-freebsd.O: 
    New baselines
    FreeBSD 9 versions simply won't run on FreeBSD 11.1.
    So now we start afresh with a new FreeBSD 11.1
    environment.
  * sarubbo-11/*.bin: New tests related to reading
    corrupt frame data.
