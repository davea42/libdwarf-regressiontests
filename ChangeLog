     * DWARFTEST.sh: Added START where it was ommitted after =====
     * dwarfextract/dwarfextract.c: Add #defines so the test will build
       with bfd.h on FreeBSD  10.2
     * legendre/RUNTEST.sh: gcc->cc so this works on FreeBSD 10 too.
     * test-alex2/RUNTEST: gcc->cc so this works on FreeBSD 10 too.
