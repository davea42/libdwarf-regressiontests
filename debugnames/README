$comp -I../../lib/libdwarf -gdwarf-5 -gpubnames \
jitreader.c -lz /tmp/libdwarf.a

Built with -gdwarf-5 -gpubnames
    dwarfdump 
Built in the same way.
    jitreader

So each has multiple debug names tables.

Adding -flto results in merging multiple tables
into one big table in .debug_names.
An example of that is in:
    dwarfdumpone

dwarfdump --print-debug-names
