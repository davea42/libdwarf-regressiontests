David Anderson. May 2010

Unless otherwise specified in a source file, everything in
the dwarf testing directory (recursively) is considered to
be covered by the BSD license, a license allowing free use
by anyone.

The intent is to be non-restrictive. Nothing about correctness
or usability is guaranteed.

Contributors have allowed this use.  Some contributions
have been transformed by translating
the Elf instructions/data sections to all-zero-bits.  Of course
the Elf section headers and the .eh_frame and the .debug_* section
data should be kept for testing purposes (for the test case
to have any point).

See http://www.bsdnewsletter.com/bsd/license.html for
further information on the BSD license.
