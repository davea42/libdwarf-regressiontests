Here we want to verify that DW_FORM_implicit_const
is properly handled by libdwarf.

But we don't quite know how to get any compiler to
emit that. So instead we use a special option
to dwarfgen (and a simple C file t1.c compiled
to its t1.o form) to transform t1.o
into a new object that contains that DWARF5 FORM.
