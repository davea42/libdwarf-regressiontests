     * dwarfdump.O, dwarfdump2.O: latest version.
       Added support for DW_OP_GNU operators
       and latest GNU generated dwarfgen to demonstrate
       we no longer abort when reading DWARF generated
       by gcc 4.6.1 .

     * dwarfdump.O, dwarfdump2.O: latest version.
       The major change is missing line columns show as zero not -1,
       -1 was always incorrect.  And DWARF3/4 new line data is now
       printed when present.

     * dwarfdump.O, dwarfdump2.O: latest version.
2011-10-24  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * Added tests so we test all the options that
       allow URI input with URI input.
2011-10-08  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * DWARFTEST.sh now does some tests of options that
       were previously not tested. Just -S and -W are not
       tested yet.
2011-09-23  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * Adding new tests, the new  marinescu2  directory.
       Bad DWARF generation is detected, avoiding a libdwarf crash.
2011-09-16  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * Adding new test cases which exposed incomplete handling
       of elf objects with mistakes in an Elf section header
       or relocation (in marinescu directory).
2011-09-15  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * New marinescu directory contains new tests that
       were coredumping libdwarf due to errors in the
       compiler or linker.  Now libdwarf detects the
       errors and avoids a coredump.
2011-09-06  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * enciso4:  Added this directory which tests
       a new address_size: feature of dwarfdump.conf
2011-09-02  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarfdump.O, dwarfdump2.O: latest version.
2011-06-12  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarfextract: Inserting more thorough test code
       into runtests.sh script and adding new baselines
       so we can be sure we compiled in the right calls
       for the particular test (dwarf_producer_init_c or
       dwarf_producer_init) so we test both.
     * CLEANUP: Cleans out new temp files created by runtests.sh
2011-01-13  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     * dwarfdump.O, dwarfdump2.O: latest version.
     * dwarfextract/dwarfextract.c: build with original or _c
       producer_init call and callback.
     * dwarfextract/runtests.sh: build and test with both original
       and _c producer_init versions.
     * dwarfextract/testc.base:  New file, baseline for the _c 
       producer_init call. dwarfextract/testc.base
2011-01-13  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
     *  New year. Added moshe and dwarf4 directories
        with DWARF4 objects to test with.
