We'll construct a (temporary) file over 2GB in size
and insert a valid small valid object file
in at the beginning of it
and copy the section table (and maybe more) up high
to test the ability to read a big object.

After the test we delete the big object so it's
not taking up space.

Building hello (which is not something that
should be necessary, but if such is necessary
here is the recipe):
cc -g hello.c -o hello
