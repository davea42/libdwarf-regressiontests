  A corrupted MacOS objectfile containing
  segments with unknown strings as the
  segment name exceeded reasonable bounds on run time.
  Segment names are defined by the compiler
  and we now check for valid segment names.
  This vulnerability has been present since Mach-o
  object support was added in 2018.
  We now check that segment names are valid
  (such names are defined by the ABI and compiler-writers).
