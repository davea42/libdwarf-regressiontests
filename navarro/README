His comments:
Attached is file that shows the problem. Using objcopy -R I
removed most of the sections (like .text or .data) and used
your zero utility to write zeroes in other areas (not that
it mattered at all as it was a simple test program). I then
used objcopy --compress-debug-sections on it.

Running dwarfdump -r on it will fail with ./dwarfdump ERROR:
dwarf_get_aranges:  DW_DLE_ARANGE_OFFSET_BAD (134)

If you do objcopy --decompress-debug-sections, then dwarfdump
-r will work.
