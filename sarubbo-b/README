This is CVE-2016-10254.  A libelf issue,
but let's test it with libdwarf.

Reported by Agostino Sarubbo 2016-11-04

← elfutils: memory allocation failure in __libelf_set_rawdata_wrlock (elf_getdata.c)
jasper: use after free in jas_realloc (jas_malloc.c) →
During the fuzz of libdwarf, I noticed a memory allocation failure which involves elfutils.
Actually there is a proposed patch on the elfutils mailing list, but nobody commented.
