Hi,

I think there is a bug in dwarf2read.c which can be exposed by
attempting to set a break point at RealIO_WriteFixed in this
executable.

I acknowledge the (gnu modula-2 generated executable) could probably
be at fault, nevertheless it does contain cyclic data structures which
are not explicitly created in the same way as C.  For example:


TYPE
  ScanState =  PROCEDURE (CHAR, VAR ScanClass, VAR ScanState);



is allowed and I suspect that this (or one just like it) is causing
the problem below.  The following is a 64 bit executable built on
Debian Lenny.
