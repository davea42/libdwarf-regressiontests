I've had another crash reported reading an apparently bogus file:

  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1294264

The problem seems to be that the dwarf_abbrev is marked as a zero-init section in the ELF which means dbg->de_debug_abbrev.dss_data is null as there is no data loaded, and hence abbrev_ptr is null when it is dereferenced.

Trying to dump with readelf reports an error:

% readelf --debug-dump=abbrev awbug6.elf
section '.debug_abbrev' has the NOBITS type - its contents are unreliable.

April 19,2019. With dwarfdump currently intesting, we get

/tmp/bld/dwarfdump/dwarfdump ERROR:  dwarf_srcfiles:  DW_DLE_LINE_OFFSET
_WRONG_FORM(336) Corrupt dwarf. Attempting to continue.

Then we print the rest of the .debug_info (no line data).

The attribute is DW_AT_stmt_list (16)
and the form is 1 (DW_FORM_addr)
and that is definitely wrong.
