I've had another crash reported reading an apparently bogus file:

  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1294264

The problem seems to be that the dwarf_abbrev is marked as a zero-init section in the ELF which means dbg->de_debug_abbrev.dss_data is null as there is no data loaded, and hence abbrev_ptr is null when it is dereferenced.

Trying to dump with readelf reports an error:

% readelf --debug-dump=abbrev awbug6.elf
section '.debug_abbrev' has the NOBITS type - its contents are unreliable.
