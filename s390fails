The following represent issues/bugs. 
Things to be fixed.
Everything else works, I believe.

1)
=====START   offsetfromlowpc sh runtest.sh ../dwarfgen .././dwarfdump  ../simplereader
FAIL C run .././dwarfdump -i -M junktesthipcoffsetorig.o
FAIL offsetfromlowpc
diff baseadvlocf junkadvlocf
Here we get an odd frame address. Surely another issue
of an inapplicable constant (not located yet).

2)
sh  debugfissionb/runtest.sh
Not finding fission sections.

3)
=====START   data16 runtest.sh
FAIL data16 build junk.bin from dwarfgen
FAIL data16  
The MIN_INST_LENGTH pro_line.h shows is wrong
for the object/host (depends on a define) 

4)
FAIL dwgena test DWARF2 -vvv 9
update via: mv junk9.new test9.base ; gzip test9.base
FAIL dwgena/runtest.sh
Ah. this is not good either.


5)
=====START   dwarfextract/runtest.sh .././dwarfdump /tmp/regressionbuild /home/linux1/dwarf/regressiontests/../code /home/linux1/dwarf/regressiontests/libdwarf.a
dwarfextract.c:91:17: fatal error: bfd.h: No such file or directory
