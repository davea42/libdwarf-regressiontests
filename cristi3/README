The object is actually fine, but it coredumped
with -m, so it was bad for libdwarf.

Also had a problem with testing a byte-past-end of info section.

This is 64 bit as compiled, but reportedly also fails -m
when compiled 32 bit.

The source must be compiled -g3 to generate macinfo to see
the problem.
