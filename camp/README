empty.o has both .debug_str and .debug_str.dwo
(and so on).  libdwarf does not yet handle this.

libdwarf needs to handle this.

However, this object is not in real DWARF5 format
in the CU.  The format changed for CU headers
at a recent DWARF committee meeting.
So the object file is unusable, unfortunately.

Thanks to Phil Camp for providing this test case.
