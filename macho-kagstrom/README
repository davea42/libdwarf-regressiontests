We were handling  strx forms in the DWARF5 line table
incorrectly, so printing the lines did not work.

This was because, in certain call sequences not seen in
dwarfdump, we were assuming .debug_str_offsets
was loaded into libdwarf when in fact that
_dwarf_load_section(dbg, &dbg->de_debug_str_offsets,error)
had not been called.

Now we call whenever needing the size or address
of that section (we added the call in three places).
