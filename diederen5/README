This is a series of fuzzed object files, each
with serious object and/or DWARF errors.
Each provokes, in libdwarf, a segmentation violation,
a leak, or both.

id-000347-sig-06-src-001923-op-havoc-rep-2 is interesting as
in .debug_aranges it has a segment_selector_size of 1.
Segment selectors are not really defined in sufficient
detail to use.

Thanks to Arnaud Diederen and Ilfak Guilfanov
for providing these testcases.
