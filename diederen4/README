Using libdwarf's `dwarfdump`, however, will not segfault.

That's because one of the key differences between `dwarfdump`
and our tool, is in how it treats errors: it treats them more lightly
than `dwarfdump`, and soldiers on, proceeding as if nothing
bad happened.

But modifying dwarfdump/print_die.c in the following way,
*just* so it keeps trying to extract attributes, and keeps
processing the compile unit, will reveal the bug:
---
