These tests are a response to two issues on github.
Both issues filed  April 28,2022 by pedronavf.

Issue #115 debuglink file not read if a buildid note is not present

and

Issue #113 Consider adding a flag to not check the crc32 of the debuglink file

We corrected code in libdwarf (and refactored a little
bit to aid understanding the code).

We added a new libdwarf function dwarf_suppress_debuglink_crc()
so one can suppress the crc.

we added a new dwarfdump option --suppress-debuglink-crc.
