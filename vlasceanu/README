Example From Christian  Vlasceanu  Jan 3 2011


Here is a test case in source.

"I generated the files on a Ubuntu 11.10 64 bit system by running:
clang++ -O0 -g const.cpp
and
clang++ -O0 -g -c const.cpp"

const.cpp  
const.o
a.out  

If these use the form DW_FORM_addr, do they do so correctly?
Does dwarfdump or libdwarf handle it correctly?

That FORM is not a reference, so dwarf_global_formref()
won't read it.  DWARF2 documented that form confusingly
and incorrectly, DWARF3 and later are the appropriate references.
