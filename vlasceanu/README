Example From Christian  Vlasceanu  Jan 3 2011


Here is a test case in source.

"I generated the files on a Ubuntu 11.10 64 bit system by running:
clang++ -O0 -g const.cpp
and
clang++ -O0 -g -c const.cpp"

const.cpp  
const.o
a.out  

If these use the form DW_FORM_addr, do they do so correctly?
  Answer: NO, at least not on DW_AT_stmt_list
Does dwarfdump or libdwarf handle it correctly?
  Answer: Given it is malformed DWARF libdwarf
          properly reports an error.

That DW_FORM_addr is not a reference, so dwarf_global_formref()
won't read it.  DWARF2 documented that form confusingly
and incorrectly, DWARF3 and later are the appropriate references.

Clang 2.9 also generates incorrect attributes on DW_TAG_friend.

The following bug reports deal with the mistakes libdwarf
finds in the generated DWARF.
